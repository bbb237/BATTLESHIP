# BATTLESHIP
Play Battleship against a computer! Implements a 2D array to interact with the gameboard which is then displayed after each turn. This version of Battleship only plays with one ship of length 4 and can be oriented both horizontally or vertically. Games are implemented without any no. of attempts restrictions for the player, meaning the player always wins and the game ends with the "You won the game with x attempts" message.
